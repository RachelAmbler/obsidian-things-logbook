# üìï Things Logbook for Obsidian

[![Build plugin](https://github.com/RachelAmbler/obsidian-things-logbook/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RachelAmbler/obsidian-things-logbook/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) will periodically sync your [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) Logbook with your Obsidian Daily Notes.

## Why?

Anecdotally, I love using Things for task management. But I also want Obsidian daily notes to be a holistic view of my day-to-day. This plugin dumps completed tasks from Things into my daily notes, meaning I can keep my same workflow, and my Second Brain has a new data source.

## Disclaimer üö®

The initial sync will back-fill your entire Things Logbook into Obsidian. This potentially means creating/modifying hundreds of files. I recommend testing this plugin out in a new vault first to make sure you're happy with the result.

### Backup your data

While I have tested this plugin with my own data, your mileage may vary. I am not at fault for any data loss that may incur. Backup your data!

## Usage

This plugin will fetch all your historical tasks and dumps them into the Daily Note corresponding to the **completed date** of the task.

It also displays any subtasks, tags, or areas associated to the tasks.

It will re-fetch the tasks at a designated interval.
